## OBJECTIVE
The main business objective of this challenge is to quantify the statistical significance of a public health policy introduced by African governments to slow down the spread of COVID-19. 

## DATA
The data that will be used comes from the COVID-19 project by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University.  The python package that comes with the key code (Priesmann et al.) already contains a python class to download the relevant data from John Hopkins database.
